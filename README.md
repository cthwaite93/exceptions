# EXCEPTIONS
In the different branches of this repo, there's little bits and pieces of code for the basic understanding of exceptions and exception handling in Java.
### Simple examples branch
In this branch you will find an example of marked exceptions **eg:** When you try and read from *BufferedReader* class there's an *IOException* thrown. 

You can also find a method named *joyDivision()* that emulates the propagation of a **RuntimeException** when we divide by 0. There's three methods call to see how the exception goes through the call stack and how we throw, propagate and catch an exception.

### Account
Simple classes to resemble how a bank account works. It has only one exception and this code is to teach how to implement custom exceptions and work with them

### ATM
Simple little program that resembles how an ATM works. We use an improved *Account* class with custom exceptions that permit us to emulate an ATM

### Color RGB
Simple program that permits us to store information of a Pixel. It also allows us to practice exceptions and propagation of exceptions through different classes.

## You are free to download and use this code freely for any use.
